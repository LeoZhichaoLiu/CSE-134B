Change in sites:
Since I create wrongly in the content of portfolio website in HW2, this time
I change a lots in terms of the content, and make it more like the portforlio
site for my experience in CS field. I change my sections to skills, education,
and experience. I lists many details about the information of my experience in
Computer Science, and what works I have done for it. Like in skills part, I 
create a table to show my skills and related courses; in experience part, I 
lists my projects, awards, and work experience with correponding pictures.
I also add the section in education to introduce UCSD as the reference to my 
information. Other than the contents, I also delete some useless form, and add 
some styles to make the site more clear to the audience. 

For the third-party js, I use Google Analytics for tracking the users visiting my
pages. I add the scripts including my measurement id in html's header. So, when
any users visited my cites, the activity data will be transfered in Firebase 
Analytics section for view and analyze. The reason I want to add is that by using
this analytics tool, we can know what are the users' preference, interests, category
to my cites. For example, I may know what time the recuriter like to visit my cite,
or which parts they like to visit more. By knowing these information, I can know 
where to improve my cite and also other information that can help me.
